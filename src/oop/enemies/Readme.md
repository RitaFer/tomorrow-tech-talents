You must implement a basic system that represents a game with 4 enemy types: generic, vampire, snake and giant. All of them should have an attacking, catching and interacting function. The catch method must take an attack type and its damage as a parameter.

### Implementation Rules

#### Generic
**Attack:** should print *"Did 10 damage"* <br />
**Catch:** should print *"received [damage taken] from damage"* <br />
**Interact:** should print *"Why would I answer my enemy???"* <br />
<hr />

#### Vampire
**Attack:** should print *"done 20 damage"* and then *"your character is bleeding"* <br />
**Catch:** should print *"received [damage taken] from damage"*, if the type of damage taken is *"piercing"* the damage taken is doubled. <br />
**Interact:** should print *"What is a man?"* <br />
<hr />

#### Snake
**Attack:** should print *"done 10 damage"* and then *"your character is poisoned"* <br />
**Catch:** should print *"received [damage taken] from damage"*, if the type of damage taken is *"slam"* the damage taken is doubled. <br />
**Interact:** should print *"If you light the flame the curse ends."* <br />
<hr />

#### Giant
**Attack:** should print *"done 25 damage"* and then *"your character is stunned"* <br />
**Catch:** should print *"received [damage taken] from damage"*, if the type of damage taken is *"fire"* the damage taken is doubled. <br />
**Interact:** should print *"I'm sorry"* <br />


## Final Tips

 - Despite being a polymorphism exercise, try to use the other concepts learned in the exercise.
 - Create as many classes, variables and methods as you need to run the exercise.
 - Try to be declarative about the names of methods, classes and variables.
 - Do not keep the doubts to yourself, share them with the teachers and the class, sometimes more colleagues have the same problem, or it is an issue that was not initially thought of by the teachers.
 - Take advantage of the exercise to fix the concepts taught in class.
