Use support methods inside the classes to make your work easier, cleaning and maintaining your code!
Create as many classes, variables and methods as you need to perform the exercise.
Try to be declarative about the names of methods, classes and variables.
Do not keep the doubts to yourself, share them with the teachers and the class, sometimes more colleagues have the same problem, or it is an issue that was not initially thought of by the teachers.
Take advantage of the exercise to fix the concepts taught in class.
