You must create concrete classes that perform the basic operations of a calculator by implementing a **Calculate** interface.
  

### Implementation Rules
  

- There must be at least 4 concrete classes in the system: Addition, Subtraction, Addition and Division.

- You can choose which return you want for the method defined in the **Calculate** interface.

- There should be a menu when starting the calculator that will ask which operation you want to perform.
- Create a class with a **main** method demonstrating how your calculator works.





## Final Tips


- The interface is a **contract**, the more succinct and cohesive it is, the greater its reuse.
- If you want to go further and add new features to your calculator.

- Create as many classes, variables and methods as you need to run the exercise.

- Try to be declarative about the names of methods, classes and variables.

- Do not keep the doubts to yourself, share them with the teachers and the class, sometimes more colleagues have the same problem, or it is an issue that was not initially thought of by the teachers.

- Take advantage of the exercise to fix the concepts taught in class.
